This dataset comprises 25 Hmong-Mien varieties, which were originally digitized from the source by Doug Cooper and later shared publicly on Wiktionary. We list the data in segmented form, adding also morpheme boundaries.

We have added a couple of custom commands that allow you to follow a specific workflow for computer-assisted language comparison. In order to do so, install the package and its dependencies, and then test the following commands:

```
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien check_profile 
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien wf_select
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien wf_partial
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien wf_alignment
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien wf_crosssemantic
$ cldfbench chenhmongmien wf_correspondence
```
